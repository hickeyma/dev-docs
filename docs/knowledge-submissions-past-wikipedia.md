# Knowledge Submissions Past Wikipedia

## Problem Statement

For us to continue building our knowledge taxonomy tree we need more trusted places to
teach our models about the world. Wikipedia can get us only so far, so we need safe
places we can take the data from.

## Proposed Solution

Due to the restrictions of copyright law, and how the internet is put together
we need a list of possible places we can eventually approve as content providers.
This document is will provide places that we would like to propose other then
Wikipedia for our legal experts to start investigating if they can be
on the [approved list][approved]. We have questions and thoughts from
community members on places that should be approved, so here is a place
can continue the discussion and track ideas from our community.

### Proposed Domains

Status:

- `approved`: Approved by the legal team, and posted on the [approved list][approved].
- `denied`: Denied by the legal team, and posted on the [avoided list][avoided].
- `submitted`: Sent to the legal team for review
- `proposed`: The community would like to propose this as a possible place to take knowledge submissions from.
- `reviewed - manually verify`: Legal team has reviewed this domain and while much of its source material meets our open licensing criteria, not all of it does. Each submission from this source must be manually verified to actually be under an appropriate content license or definitively in the public domain.

For the purposes of Knowledge submissions to the InstructLab project, data sourced from items in the `approved` category require no further vetting from the Triage and/or other Maintainer teams. Items in the `reviewed - manually verify` category will require vetting before the submission can be accepted.

To ensure that the data you would like to include in your knowledge submission meets the project licensing criteria, please make sure to talk to the Taxonomy maintainer team *before* you begin work on your submission. We would hate for you to do a great deal of work only to be told that the data source you selected would not work for the project. Please make sure you review the [Getting Started with Knowledge Submissions](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-with-knowledge-contributions) documentation prior to submitting your request.

### Process steps

1. Collect suggested places from the community by requesting they submit a pull request against this dev doc.
1. Work with our legal team to adjudicate. [@lhawthorn](https://github.com/lhawthorn) is currently the owner of this step, but is happy to educate & empower other folks to do this work.
1. Inform the triage team and triagers of the new locations we can or can not accept. This is currently done via an announcement in the [daily Triager Standup](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/Collaboration.md#triager-standup) and via a pull request to update the Knowledge Guide in one of the two locations listed below.
